# Log Analyzer

Small utility webserver written to analyze logs with web UI.

I did not wanted to install a big, elasticsearch-based solution on my small VPS where log volume is extremely low. This tool is a HTTP sink for my [log aggregation](https://vector.dev/) service I'm running on my private server.
